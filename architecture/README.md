# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for our project, primarily using D2 diagrams to visualize different aspects of the system.

## Contents

1. `overall-architecture.d2`: A D2 file describing the overall system architecture.
2. `data-model.d2`: A D2 file illustrating the data model and relationships between entities.

## Rendered Diagrams

The rendered versions of these D2 diagrams are also included in this directory:

1. `overall-architecture.png`: The rendered image of the overall system architecture.
2. `data-model.png`: The rendered image of the data model.

These diagrams provide a visual representation of our system's architecture and data structure, making it easier to understand and communicate the design to team members and stakeholders.
